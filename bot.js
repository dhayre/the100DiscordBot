__**There are a few things you need to do to gain full access to the Discord:**__

     **1**) Join our group on the100.io. This is where we schedule our games. You can still LFG in Discord, but this is the core of our group. https://www.the100.io/g/3140

     **2**) Be sure to set your nickname to let people know how to find you on your main platform (e.g. "Username#1234 (Bungie)" or "Username (Steam)").  
     
     To do this:
     - right click your name in Discord
     - select "Edit Server Profile"
     - change your nickname in the text box 
     - click "Save Changes" at the bottom of the screen.  

     See here for more info: https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/219070107-Server-Nicknames

     **3**) Familiarize yourself with our ${bot.channels.find('name', 'rules_and_info')}.

     **4**) Once you've done everything above, post in ${bot.channels.find('name', 'welcome_new_members')} to get promoted to Grunt and have full acess to our Discord.

That's it! If you have any questions, please let a member of the leadership team know or post in ${bot.channels.find('name', 'welcome_new_members')} for help.`
